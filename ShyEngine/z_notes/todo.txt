EASY:
- Use the correct shader when rendering a Glyph
- Compile shaders with their code / optimize shader compiling by saving shader object files and checking if they exist
	before compiling the shaders

MEDIUM:
- Custom renderers (most importantly, debug renderer)
- Custom scripts
- Proper destructors and module detachment
- Game screen management
- Module enable / disable
- Documentation

HARD:
- Take rotation in account when colliding or with the physics engine
- Spatial partitioning
- Memory leaks

PHYSICS-HARD:
- Advanced gravity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta_methods (optional, takes resources but it's very accurate)
- Collision points <- requires Spatial partitioning
- GJK <- requires Collision points
- Constraints (https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-iii-constrained-rigid-body-simulation) <- requires Collision points
