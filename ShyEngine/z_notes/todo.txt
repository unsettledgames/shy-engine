- AABB collisions and CollisionManager
- Circle collisions
- Spatial partitioning
- Physics


- Add a debug window and a debug manager where I can put textures and easily print stuff onto it
- Since vectors are contiguous only with reserve (they're not with resize), it could be useful to let the user register 
	components and only after they're done, actually create the vectors
- Custom spatial partitioning. I'm not sure I like Ben's implementation, I'd like to have something way more generic,
	but I think I'd need a proper collision class and structure in order to do so. In spatial partitioning, instead of checking
	all the objects against themselves, you just check the cells with *:
	*	*	X
	*	*	X
	*	X	X
- Collision system: start with circle / AABB colliders just to flesh out the basic structure.
- IMainGame and IGameScreen suck big time, their only purpose is to take part of the window features and put them in a new
	class. Kinda ok but it should be done in a different class (something like Engine probably, in which we take care of SDL
	initialization and the Engine components initialization). The screen management part should be some kind of Scene system
	instead.
- Add proper destructors
- Use the correct shader when rendering a Glyph
