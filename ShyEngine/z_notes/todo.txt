EASY:
- Index drawing 
- Use the correct shader when rendering a Glyph
- Compile shaders with their code / optimize shader compiling by saving shader object files and checking if they exist
	before compiling the shaders

MEDIUM:
- Custom renderers (most importantly, debug renderer)
- Custom scripts
- Proper destructors and module detachment
- Game screen management

HARD:
- Spatial partitioning
- Memory leaks
