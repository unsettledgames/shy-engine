- AABB collisions and CollisionManager
- Circle collisions
- Spatial partitioning


- Add a debug window and a debug manager where I can put textures and easily print stuff onto it

- Collision system: start with circle / AABB colliders just to flesh out the basic structure.
- IMainGame and IGameScreen suck big time, their only purpose is to take part of the window features and put them in a new
	class. Kinda ok but it should be done in a different class (something like Engine probably, in which we take care of SDL
	initialization and the Engine components initialization). The screen management part should be some kind of Scene system
	instead.
- Add proper destructors
- Use the correct shader when rendering a Glyph

Polish:
- Let the programmer choose how to group the data

Bugs:
- Framerate calculator not stable with low framerates
